## Project Summary

Our project, BBDB (Basketball Database), takes sports data analytics to the next level. We’re focusing on basketball, which has an incredible amount of data. It’s a web app that makes it easy for the user to get whatever data they want, for any year, game, team, and even player. 
	The search feature will have many different parameters that can be customized to provide all the information the user needs. The added visualizations and other features help make the data easier to understand and compare, and other players/teams/etc with similar stats can be suggested. BBDB expands on what can be done with all of the basketball data available nowadays.
